			<p class="content">A black panther is the melanistic color variant of any big cat species. Black panthers in Asia and Africa are leopards (Panthera
			pardus), and those in the Americas are black jaguars (Panthera onca).Black coat coloration is attributed to the expression of recessive alleles in leopards and dominant alleles in jaguars. In
			each species, a certain combination of alleles stimulates the production of large amounts of the dark pigment melanin in
			the animalâ€™s fur and skin.</p>
